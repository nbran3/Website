											<h2>Welcome to my Portfolio Website!</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hello! I'm Noah Brannon, and I appreciate you taking the time to explore my portfolio. I graduated from the University of Michigan - Dearborn in December 2022, where I earned a degree in Economics and a minor in History. 
											Currently, I reside in Trenton, Michigan, which is located just 20 minutes south of Detroit. I am eagerly seeking my first post-graduate job. Ideally, I am looking for opportunities in Metro Detroit, 
											but I am open to relocating to Grand Rapids or Lansing in Michigan, as well as the Chicago Area or Columbus and Cleveland in Ohio. This portfolio showcases my personal projects, where I have utilized 
											Python, SQL, MS Excel, and data visualization tools like Tableau and PowerBI. The majority of these projects revolve around the realms of Economics or Finance, as those are the areas where I feel most confident and adept. 
											For a seamless viewing experience and to observe the results, I have presented the Python projects in Jupyter Notebooks. However, please note that downloading the code might pose some challenges if you choose to do so. 
											In the near future, I am planning to pursue a Master's Degree in either Applied Economics or Statistics to enhance my skills and knowledge further. Last updated 9/7/2023.</p>

										<h3>Housing Prices Forecasting</h3>
										<p>This machine learning project focuses on predicting real estate price movements using economic data. The dataset includes various economic indicators such as mortgage rates, consumer sentiment, inflation rates, housing supply, and stock market performance.
										The machine learning model used for prediction is a RandomTreeClassifier, which has shown an accuracy rate of 71%. To validate the model and assess its performance, backtesting techniques are applied. 
										Backtesting involves testing the model on historical data to evaluate how well it would have performed in the past.
										By analyzing these economic factors and using machine learning techniques, the project aims to provide insights into real estate market trends and assist in making informed decisions for buying or selling properties.

										<h3>Economic Indicators Statistical Analysis</h3>
										<p>The project explores the relationships between the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Unemployment Rate, and the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) in the United States from 1960 to 2022. It was entirely done within R, including the analysis, 
											explanations and graphs. Its main objectives include examining the validity of the 
											Phillips Curve theory, analyzing the relationship between CPI and the FFR in the context of the Federal Reserve's efforts to control inflation, and exploring the correlations between CPI, Unemployment Rate, and FFR 
											using statistical analysis techniques. The project presents various visualizations, summary statistics, correlation plots, and linear regression models to illustrate the findings. All data was obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis (FRED).

										<h3>AutoStock ETL Engine</h3>
										<p> Through Python and essential libraries, I established an automated pipeline to retrieve daily historical stock price data from the Yahoo Finance API, timed for closure at 4 pm EST. 
											Employing Pandas, I thoughtfully organized the data into separate Data Frames for columns such as 'Close,' 'High,' and others. These structured datasets were then exported to Excel files, enabling integration into a uniform format, 
											for direct insertion into an SQL database via Python using the SQLEngine library

											<h3>GDP API Web Scraping and Predictive Modeling</h3>
											<p>In this project, I connected to the Bureau of Economic Analysis API to scrape the GDP data for each state. I collected GDP information from the years 1998, 2002, 2007, 2012, 2017, and 2022. Using this data, 
												I developed a model to predict the GDP for each state in 2027. It is worth noting that the model's projections may seem exaggerated since the selected data did not account for any recessions or economic downturns. As each year used was before or after any of the three recessions that occured in the United States during the timeframe. 
												Consequently, the model assumed a continuous upward trend in GDP. However, while the results may appear ambitious, they are not entirely unrealistic, and detailed explanations justifying these projections can be 
												found in the README file. Source - <a href='https://github.com/nbran3/Portfolio/tree/main/Econometrics/GDPForecasting'>Link</a>

										<h3>Census Project</h3>
										<p>This comprehensive project revolved around analyzing Census Data obtained from the United States Census Bureau. Throughout the project, I utilized a combination of SQL, Python, and PowerBI. In SQL, 
											I extensively explored the data using various techniques such as basic syntax, aggregation, window functions, joins, subqueries, case statements, and create view functions.
											I used PowerBI to create a visually appealing presentation summarizing the insights extracted from the SQL analysis (Views). Additionally, I employed Python for further data analysis, specifically to identify statistical relationships 
											among three variables: median earnings, the proportion of college graduates in each state, and the proportion of individuals with health insurance in each state. 
											 Here is the source code for the project - <a href='https://github.com/nbran3/Portfolio/tree/main/CensusProject'>Link</a>

											<h3>Store Sales </h3>
											<p>
												This SQL project focuses on analyzing a hypothetical Store Sales dataset I got from Kaggle. I created new columns such as revenue, profit margin, and discounted price difference based on existing columns such as profit, quantity, etc. 
												The project calculates various metrics such as average sales, total sales, total revenue, average discount, total quantity, and average order duration per region (East, Central, etc.) and state. It also examines the most common shipping method, 
												popular category purchases, and profitability by category and state. Additionally, it identifies customers with the highest sales, profits, and profit margins.  
												Visualizations of the analysis are available in Tableau Source- <a href='https://github.com/nbran3/Portfolio/tree/main/SQL/StoreSales'>Link</a> Tableau Public <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/noah.brannon/viz/StoreSales_16879837384680/PRMAP">Link</a>

												<h3>Baseball Project</h3>
												<p>In this project, I conducted an extensive data analysis of baseball statistics from 1945 to 2015, utilizing Python and Microsoft Excel. Using Python, I performed a comprehensive statistical analysis to explore the relationship 
												between the number of home runs and strikeouts per season, revealing a positive correlation between these variables. To gain further insights, I implemented an ARIMA model to forecast three seasons' worth of wins for each of 
												the 30 MLB teams. Based on these predictions, I simulated playoff-like scenarios using a head-and-tails model that assigned higher weights to top-seeded teams. The season standings and playoffs were visualized and 
												presented using Microsoft Excel. Source - <a href='https://github.com/nbran3/Portfolio/tree/main/Baseball'>Link</a>

										<h3>S&P 500 Predictive Modeling</h3>
										<p>This project showcases a predictive model for the S&P 500 index using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on historical data from 2010 to 2022 and achieves a 57% prediction accuracy for this year's index values. 
											By leveraging the RandomForestClassifier algorithm, the model predicts whether the S&P 500 index will increase or decrease based on closing price, volume, open, high, and low features. Backtesting and precision scores 
											evaluate the model's performance, while the use of rolling averages and trend indicators enhances prediction accuracy

												<h3>United Kingdom Unemployment and Inflation Regression Analysis</h3>
												<p>This was an economic and statistical analysis to determine the relationship between the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation.
													Many people might believe there is some kind of relationship between the two variables, but they do not, and this paper confirms that. This was 
													my final school project for my Economics Statistics class. Here is the document link - <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xLK0O4-EGIqCCVaEqVNz0UpVCFGJk_Cs142qXve6tnU/edit?usp=sharing">Google Docs</a>
