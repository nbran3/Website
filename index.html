											<h2>Welcome to my Portfolio Website!</h2>
										</header>
										<p> Hello! I'm Noah Brannon, and I appreciate you taking the time to explore my portfolio. I graduated from the University of Michigan - Dearborn in December 2022, where I earned a degree in Economics and a minor in History. 
											Currently, I reside in Trenton, Michigan, which is located just 20 minutes south of Detroit. 
											I am eagerly seeking my first post-graduate job. Ideally, I am looking for opportunities in Metro Detroit, but I am open to relocating to Grand Rapids or Lansing in Michigan, as well as the Chicago Area or Columbus and Cleveland in Ohio.
											This portfolio showcases my personal projects, where I have utilized Python, SQL, MS Excel, and data visualization tools like Tableau and PowerBI. The majority of these projects revolve around the realms of Economics or Finance, as those are the 
											areas where I feel most confident and adept. For a seamless viewing experience and to observe the results, I have presented the Python projects in Jupyter Notebooks. However, please note that downloading the code might pose some challenges, if you choose to. 
											In the near future, I am planning to pursue a Master's Degree in either Applied Economics or Statistics to further enhance my skills and knowledge. Last updated 7/4/2023.

										<h3>EMA Trading Strategy Python Model</h3>
										<p>This project showcases a financial model within Python that analyzes stock market data using Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs). By utilizing libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and yfinance, the code retrieves historical price data for a specified stock, 
											such as Microsoft (example in the code), and calculates EMAs to identify price trends. The code allows users to set a specific start date (1/1/2022 used) and a specific end date(7/4/2023 used) for analysis, providing flexibility to analyze historical data as per their requirements. 
											A crossover strategy determines optimal buying and selling points based on EMA values. The code evaluates the strategy's performance, calculating metrics such as total gains, losses, and return on investment.

										<h3>Census Project</h3>
										<p>This comprehensive project revolved around the analysis of Census Data obtained from the United States Census Bureau. Throughout the project, I utilized a combination of SQL, Python, and PowerBI. In SQL, 
											I extensively explored the data using various techniques such as basic syntax, aggregation, window functions, joins, subqueries, case statements, and create view functions.
											I used PowerBI to create a visually appealing presentation summarizing the insights extracted from the SQL analysis (Views). Additionally, I employed Python for further data analysis, specifically to identify statistical relationships 
											among three variables: median earnings, the proportion of college graduates in each state, and the proportion of individuals with health insurance in each state. 
											 Here is the source code for the project - <a href='https://github.com/nbran3/Portfolio/tree/main/CensusProject'>Link</a>

										<h3>S&P 500 Predictive Modeling</h3>
										<p>This project showcases a predictive model for the S&P 500 index using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on historical data from 2010 to 2022 and achieves a 57% prediction accuracy for this year's index values. 
											By leveraging the RandomForestClassifier algorithm, the model predicts whether the S&P 500 index will increase or decrease based on features like closing price, volume, open, high, and low. Backtesting and precision scores 
											evaluate the model's performance, while the use of rolling averages and trend indicators enhances prediction accuracy

											<h3>GDP API Web Scraping and Predictive Modeling</h3>
											<p>In this project, I connected to the Bureau of Economic Analysis API to scrape the GDP data for each state. I collected GDP information from the years 1998, 2002, 2007, 2012, 2017, and 2022. Using this data, 
												I developed a model to predict the GDP for each state in 2027. It is worth noting that the model's projections may seem exaggerated since the selected data did not account for any recessions or economic downturns. As each year used was before or after any of the three recessions that occured in the United States during the timeframe. 
												Consequently, the model assumed a continuous upward trend in GDP. However, while the results may appear ambitious, they are not entirely unrealistic, and detailed explanations justifying these projections can be 
												found in the README file. Source - <a href='https://github.com/nbran3/Portfolio/tree/main/GDPForecasting'>Link</a>

											<h3>Baseball Project</h3>
											<p>In this project, I conducted an extensive data analysis of baseball statistics from 1945 to 2015, utilizing Python and Microsoft Excel. Using Python, I performed a comprehensive statistical analysis to explore the relationship between the number of home runs and strikeouts per season, 
												revealing a positive correlation between these variables. To gain further insights, I implemented an ARIMA model to forecast three seasons' worth of wins for each of the 30 MLB teams. Based on these predictions, 
												I simulated playoff-like scenarios using a head-and-tails model that assigned higher weights to top-seeded teams. The season standings and playoffs were visualized and presented using Microsoft Excel.

											<h3>Store Sales Project </h3>
											<p>
												This SQL project focuses on analyzing a hypothetical Store Sales dataset I got from Kaggle. I created new columns such as revenue, profit margin, and discounted price difference based on existing columns such as profit, quantity etc.. 
												The project calculates various metrics such as average sales, total sales, total revenue, average discount, total quantity, and average order duration per region (East, Central, etc.) and state. It also examines the most common shipping method, 
												popular category purchases, and profitability by category and state. Additionally, it identifies customers with the highest sales, profits, and profit margins.  
												Visualizations of the analysis are available in Tableau. SQL Code - <a href='https://github.com/nbran3/Portfolio/tree/main/SQL/StoreSales'>Link</a>, Tableau Public - <a href='https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/noah.brannon/viz/StoreSales_16879837384680/PRMAP'>Link</a>

												<h3>Wine Dataset Analysis</h3>
												<p>This was a simple data analysis project analyzing wine from around the world. I also created a linear regression model to determine the relationship between the price of wine
												and the ratings of wine via Python on a Jupyter Notebook. I found that there was a weak positive to almost no relationship between the price of wine and the rating of wine, meaning that ratings of wine do not impact 
												the price of wine that much.

												<h3>NYC Airbnb Project</h3>
												<p>
													In this SQL project analyzing a dataset of Airbnb listings in New York City from 2019-2020, I calculated average prices and occupancy days by neighborhood, created columns for price-to-occupancy and 
													price-to-review ratios, analyzed overall metrics for NYC Airbnbs, identified high-ratio listings, examined borough averages, and categorized neighborhoods as above or below average when it came to price and the two newly created metrics mentioned earlier. 
													The project provided insights into pricing trends and occupancy patterns across neighborhoods
													in New York City. Visualizations of the analysis are available in Tableau.

												<h3>United Kingdom Unemployment and Inflation Regression Analysis</h3>
												<p>This was an economic and statistical analysis to determine the relationship between the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation.
													Many people might believe there is some kind of relationship between the two variables, but they do not, and this paper confirms that. This was 
													my final school project for my Economics Statistics class. Here is the document link - <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xLK0O4-EGIqCCVaEqVNz0UpVCFGJk_Cs142qXve6tnU/edit?usp=sharing">Google Docs</a>
