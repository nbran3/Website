                    </header>
                    <p>Hello! I'm Noah Brannon, and I appreciate you taking the time to explore my portfolio. I graduated from the University of Michigan - Dearborn in December 2022, earning a degree in Economics and a minor in History.
                        Currently, I reside in Trenton, Michigan, which is located just 20 minutes south of Detroit. Ideally, I am looking for opportunities in Metro Detroit,
                        but I am open to relocating to Grand Rapids or Lansing in Michigan, as well as the Chicago Area. This portfolio showcases data projects, where I have utilized
                        Python, SQL, MS Excel, data visualization tools like Tableau, and CI/CD tools like Docker and Terraform for use in data analysis, data engineering, and machine learning. The majority of these projects revolve around the realms of Economics or Finance,
                        as those are the areas where I feel most confident and adept.
                        Last updated 2/19/2024.</p>

                    <h3>Housing Prices Forecasting</h3>
                    <p>This machine learning project uses economic data to predict real estate price movements. The dataset includes various economic indicators such as mortgage rates, consumer sentiment, inflation rates, housing supply, and stock market performance.
                        The machine learning model used for prediction is a RandomTreeClassifier, which has shown an accuracy rate of 71%. To validate the model and assess its performance, backtesting techniques are applied.
                        Backtesting involves testing the model on historical data to evaluate how well it would have performed in the past.
                        By analyzing these economic factors and using machine learning techniques, the project aims to provide insights into real estate market trends and assist in making informed decisions for buying or selling properties.

                    <h3>US County GDP Python Choropleth Mapper</h3>
                    <p> 	Developed a choropleth map visualization using the
                        Python library Folium to display the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of U.S. counties for the year
                        2022. The project involved importing a JSON shapefile for county boundaries and extracting GDP
                        data from a local SQL Server database. Utilized Pandas for data manipulation and Folium for map
                        creation. Folium seamlessly generates Leaflet, a powerful JavaScript library for interactive maps,
                        by providing a high-level Pythonic interface and implements the code within an HTML file. Implemented a tooltip feature to display county names and GDP values on hover.

                        <h3>GDP API Web Scraping and Predictive Modeling</h3>
                        <p>In this project, I connected to the Bureau of Economic Analysis API to scrape the GDP data for each state. I collected GDP information from the years 1998, 2002, 2007, 2012, 2017, and 2022. Using this data,
                            I developed a model to predict the GDP for each state in 2027. It is worth noting that the model's projections may seem exaggerated since the selected data did not account for any recessions or economic downturns. As each year used was before or after any of the three recessions that occurred in the United States during the timeframe.
                            Consequently, the model assumed a continuous upward trend in GDP. However, while the results may appear ambitious, they are not entirely unrealistic, and detailed explanations justifying these projections can be
                            found in the README file.

                        countries, manufacturers, and top models. Extracted key insights, such as average prices and
                        mileage by category. Presented findings in an interactive Tableau dashboard

                        <p>The project explores the relationships between the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Unemployment Rate, and the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) in the United States from 1960 to 2022. It was entirely done within R, including the analysis,
                            explanations, and graphs. Its main objectives include examining the validity of the
                            Phillips Curve theory, analyzing the relationship between CPI and the FFR in the context of the Federal Reserve's efforts to control inflation, and exploring the correlations between CPI, Unemployment Rate, and FFR
                            using statistical analysis techniques. The project presents various visualizations, summary statistics, correlation plots, and linear regression models to illustrate the findings. All data was obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis (FRED).

                            <p>This project showcases a predictive model for the S&P 500 index using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on historical data from 2010 to 2022 and achieves a 57% prediction accuracy for this year's index values.
                                By leveraging the RandomForestClassifier algorithm, the model predicts whether the S&P 500 index will increase or decrease based on closing price, volume, open, high, and low features. Backtesting and precision scores
                                evaluate the model's performance, while the use of rolling averages and trend indicators enhances prediction accuracy</p>

                            <p>
                                This SQL project focuses on analyzing a hypothetical Store Sales dataset I got from Kaggle. I created new columns such as revenue, profit margin, and discounted price difference based on existing columns such as profit, quantity, etc.
                                The project calculates various metrics such as average sales, total sales, total revenue, average discount, total quantity, and average order duration per region (East, Central, etc.) and state. It also examines the most common shipping method,
                                popular category purchases, and profitability by category and state. Additionally, it identifies customers with the highest sales, profits, and profit margins.
                                Visualizations of the analysis are available in Tableau.
